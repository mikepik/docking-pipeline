# Docking pipeline configuration file
# -----------------------------------
# Edit this file to set your receptor, ligands, and key parameters.
# Paths are RELATIVE to the folder containing this YAML file.

# (Preferred) PDB ID to download from RCSB
# Example: 4DIU
pdb_id: 4DIU

# (Optional) Path to a pre-prepared receptor file (.pdbqt)
# If this is provided, the pipeline will SKIP downloading and preparing the receptor.
# Name your pre-prepared receptor as <PDBID>_prepped.pdbqt
# Make sure this receptor file is stored in your docking directory 
#(i.e same directory the conatains the run_pipeline.py and other files)

receptor: ""

# (Optional) Chains to keep (comma-separated, e.g. "A,B")
chains: "A"

# Keep cofactors (true/false)
keep_cofactors: false

# Folder containing ligand structure files (.sdf, .mol, .mol2)
# The pipeline will automatically combine all compatible ligands in this folder.
ligand_dir: ligands/

# Output combined SDF file (auto-generated by pipeline)
combined_sdf: combined_ligands.sdf

# Folder for generated PDBQT ligand files (auto-created if missing)
pdbqt_dir: pdbqt_files/

# Folder for docking output results (auto-created if missing)
results_dir: results/

# Residues defining the binding site region (comma-separated, e.g. "A:22,A:45,A:46")
# These residues define the center and bounds of the docking box.
residues: "A:22"

# Padding (Å) beyond the min/max residue coordinates (controls docking box size)
padding: 6

# Output Vina configuration file (auto-generated)
config_out: vina_config.txt

# (Optional) Number of CPUs for AutoDock Vina (default = 8)
cpu: 8

# (Optional) Number of top ligands to extract for ChimeraX visualization
top_ligands: 5
